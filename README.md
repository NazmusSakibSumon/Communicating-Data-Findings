Udacity Data Analysis Nano Degree: Communicate Data Findings Project

Data Analysis Report: Bike Riding Trends and types of bikes of Ford Go Bike System April, 2019 by Nazmus Sakib Sumon.

The most important attributes that we have worked with in this project are riding duration, time of the day, day of the week, subscription type, member gender etc. We cleaned the data set and also changed the data type where necessary.

Summary of Findings:

1. The distribution of bike riding duration is right skewed. Our analysis indicated that most of the riding takes place between 5 minutes to 15 minutes. The median is 9 minutes and the mean is around 12 minutes.

2. There are two types of bikers: subscribers and customers. Subscribers tend to use bike riding as a commute to their work. Thats why, their riding time always concentrates on 8-9am in the morning and 17-18pm in the afternoon. Customers dont ride bike in the same pattern. Customers ride more in the weekends.

3. Bike riding duration vaires on gender also. The box plot shows a bigger box for femles and a small box for males. That means, males riding duration is more concentrated than female riders.

4. Finally bike riding durations differs in different age group too. Older rider like older than 40 years old, tend to ride early in the morning, but younger riders are little bit late. Also, there are more youngers bikers than older bikers.

Key insights for presentation:

1. The distribution of bikee riding duration is right skewed. We applied log transformation and outliner remover.

2. We analyzed pick time in a day and day in a week.

3. The different trends on biking for diiferent bikers based on age, gender, etc.
